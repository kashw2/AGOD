# AGOD - Australian Government Open Data API Wrapper

AGOD is an open sourced Australian Government Open Data API Wrapper that takes the hard part of manually substituting your own values in a body of a request or in the URL and makes it easier.

---

## Requirements

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

[node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Everything else can be installed by running 
```
npm install
```

---

## Usage

AGOD works on a promise based system and as such returns a promise for all of it's calls to the API via Fetch as such you will need to use the 'then' method to return your result. This will be updated with documentation in future releases.

#### Example

``` javascript
const agod = require('agod');

const query = {
	search: 'Acid Sulfate Soils Risk',
	dateFrom: '1975-01-31T14:00:00.000Z',
	dateTo: '2018-04-30T14:00:00.000Z',
	publisher: 'Office of Environment and Heritage (OEH)',
	region: 'STE:1',
	start: '0',
	limit: '10'
};

agod.Data.GetData(query).then((data) => {
	console.log(data);
});
```
